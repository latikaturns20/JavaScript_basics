# JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. Head to out [**wiki page**](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/JavaScript_Basics) to learn about JavaScript.

## Tutorial and Projects
Here are some good projects that it will help you understand the basics of JavaScript and how you can use different functions of JavaScript in web related logics.
(Here, we will provide you with source code of all .html, .ccs and .js file. So, you can import .html and .css file and start working on .js file(can look at .js source file if you want to take some idea). But, we recommend you also design .html and .css file as extended html/css exercise.)
